# Rainfallreader

Assumptions:
Value of 0 represents a rainfall of zero. Erronious readings are not included.
All potential values have been included in rainfall documents. It is unreasonable for the readers to supply a value that is not like those within the presented CSVs (e.g. alpha characters can never reasonably appear in the rainfall column, or non-datetime in  time column)
